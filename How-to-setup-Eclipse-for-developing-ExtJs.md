This section introduce the tools which can be used for developing web applications based on ExtJS. You can use different editors to write javascript code such as PICO, VI, gEdit, etc. I encourage you to do not use text editors, instead use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We can found various IDEs in the market. We propose to use Eclipse as it provides lot of plugins which can help for debugging or coding javascript. As well it is free.
